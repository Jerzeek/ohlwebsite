# Week 6: Building for open

_Your project grows when more and more diverse people jump in and contribute to it. This week you will go through a set of principles, values and concrete tools that will help you lower access barriers for your users and contributors, besides designing strategies for ensuring a welcoming space for everyone._

**Goal of the week:** Create entry points for contributors and users (Contributor User channels)/ Websites, issues, repositories, labels, code of conduct.

**Assignments:**

- Write your contribution guidelines.
- Share your contribution guidelines draft online (use google docs, [hackMD](https://hackmd.io/) or a markdown file in your repository to get feedback from organizers, mentors and people and participants in the community.
- Create/Reuse markdown templates for contributors to make feature requests, propose ideas, etc. [You can look at the example of testCard.md templates](https://github.com/Open-Hardware-Leaders/Examples-Templates)
- If it makes sense for your current stage, make a draft of a start guide for the users of your product.
- If there are areas that you need help with outside your core team, open an issue labelled with "help wanted" and specify the issue (for instance, logo design, website design and development, feedback on specific assumptions or hypothesis, proofreading, translations etc.)
- If you want to attract new contributors, consider creating a "first timer only" issue to keep the entry level low.
