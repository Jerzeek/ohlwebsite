# **Week 12: Active community building**

_Depending on who your users are and the domain your project is applied to, your community building strategy may vary. In the last weeks you worked a lot on defining your project and opening it up for possible contributors. During this week you will do the practical work of reaching out to these potential users and contributors, and establish your online and offline presence._

**Goal of the week:** Dedicate time to shape your project online presence and strategy for community building.

**Goal as a contributor:** Try to find minimum contribution you can make to another menteeâ€™s project based on your skills, or consider working on something new to learn new skills.

**Assignments:**
Which are the channels most used for communicating projects similar to yours? Is it making videos with use cases, preparing online training for users, participating in forums, sending newsletters, engaging via social media or YouTube? 

* Define in a paragraph your strategy and start building your online channel. 
* Contribute in at least one 'good first issue' of another project
* Share these assignments and ideas with us, we will be available everyday this week (4-8 May), 5pm UTC, [in this room](https://universityofsussex.zoom.us/my/andresroom?pwd=NFNoN2k1dTdKNkE4WHZJZmgybWhGZz09).
