# Week 6: Building for open

_Your project grows when more and more diverse people jump in and contribute to it. This week you will go through a set of principles, values and concrete tools that will help you lower access barriers for your users and contributors, besides designing strategies for ensuring a welcoming space for everyone._

**Goal of the week:** Create entry points for contributors and users. Write guidelines and templates to make using and contributing to your product/project easier.

**Assignments:**

* Write your contribution guidelines and share the draft online to get feedback from organizers, mentors and people in the community.
* Who is participating and who is not in your project? Think of strategies for engaging and including wider audiences, and define your community guidelines (or code of conduct).
* Create/Reuse markdown templates for contributors to make feature requests, propose ideas, file pull requests etc.
* If it makes sense for your current stage, make a draft of a start guide for the users of your product.
* If there are areas that you need help with outside your core team, open an issue labelled with "help wanted" and specify the issue (e. g. logo design, website design and development, feedback on specific assumptions or hypothesis, proofreading, translations)
* If you want to attract new contributors, consider creating a "first timer only" issue to keep the entry level low.
