_In the previous week you made a review of your canvas and got feedback on new assumptions. Basically you had the opportunity to go through a small cycle of identifying a problem, making an assumption on how to solve it and finding ways to test it. By reviewing things you can make better decisions on whether to keep or ditch your proposed solution and refine your model._

_This week you are going to be working on creating a [roadmap](https://business-docs.co.uk/document-templates/roadmap-document-templates/what-is-a-project-roadmap/)**. **Basically, you will take time to think about the long term goals for the specific artifact you’re building but also for the project in general (one way to do that is using [theory of change](https://www.theoryofchange.org/what-is-theory-of-change/)), and break it down to turn it into actionable steps. These steps can be divided into short, mid and long term goals. In GitHub this can be translated into issues and goals in the Kanban board._

**Goal of the week:** Visualizing your project in short, mid and  long term management within the next 1 to 2 years.

**Assignment**
Follow the basic process we have provided you in three steps
1. Define your core goals in a time span of 1 to 2 years from today
2. Specify where are you standing what have you learned, validated and achieved.
3. Define clear milestones or intermediary steps that can lead you to those goals for 1 to 2 years
If applicable and desirable to your specific context specify these milestones you have defined in a [Kanban board in github](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards), in a markdown file in the repo, or in your website.
